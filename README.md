# Rig Utility
Functions for automated rigging in Maya

Copy the rig_utility folder to your Maya's scripts path, then, from the Maya environment:  
`import rig_utility`  
or  
`from rig_utility import desired_function`


See function docstrings for usage details.  

Requires NumPy installed in Maya's embedded Python.  If you need it, locate your mayapy.exe (typically C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2022\bin\mayapy.exe) and run the following:  
`path\to\your\mayas\python\mayapy.exe -m pip install numpy`
